# Mean and Standard Deviation Tutorial

### What is a Mean?
Mean is another word for *average*.
-    The formula for the mean is the sum of a certain value of a dataset divided by the number of datapoints. 
        - Of course you are probably already familiar with this formula.
-    Like many other statistical quantities, the mean is very important when studying quantitative analysis.

### What is a Standard Deviation?
Standard deviation refers to the spread of a certain value of a dataset or more simply, it describes the average distance of a set of values from its mean.
-   The formula for standard deviation is the square root of the difference between the square of each value and the mean divided by the total number of datapoints.
       -   You are probably also familiar with this formula.
-       The standard deviation is used extensively in statistics and quantitative analysis to estimate potential values and their likelihoods.
-   **Note :** Notice that standard deviation is directly dependent on the mean. This means that analyzing distributions and the spread of values in a dataset requires you to calculate a mean.

### Why are we reviewing these basic statistics!?
Though the mean and standard deviation are simple values that are useful when trying to have a basic understanding of a dataset, they are both important in the world of **stochastics**.
-   Stochastics is a field that studies probabilities that are randomly determined but can be estimated via statistical analysis or pattern recognition.
      -  Because pattern recognition and statistical analysis includes analyzing distribution and its probabilities, both the mean and standard deviation are important values.
